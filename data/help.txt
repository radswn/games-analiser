Welcome in The Game Analiser! The main purpose of this application is to give you all the necessary information about interesting games available on the Steam platform. On the right side you may find the table containing information about each game's name, release date, its developer and price. You may sort it however you like. What is more, you may use our custom slider dedicated for price and date filtering right underneath it. Choose any game from the list to see its average number of players over time chart. A gauge presented under the chart section will show you the current number of players in comparison to the overall maximum. In case you search for new games - we listed its genres below the table. Remember to check out bonus info at the bottom of the page - we post there user ratings, number of achievements and average playtime in minutes.
